[**Habere**](https://habere-peach.vercel.app/): AI autoprioritized ticktick tasks!

[Launched on r/ticktick](https://www.reddit.com/r/ticktick/comments/1c9b91w/getting_more_done_autoprioritzing_ticktick_tasks/) with a mis-spelled heading lol. Pretty crazy the fact that people actually took time to look at the service. The `todo` file contains directions for improvement. Vercel deployment made life super easy. Used `gpt-3.5-turbo` to address the auto-prioritization (with an enforced JSON response). The prompt includes the interface the output needs to conform to. No LlamaIndex or LangChain usage.
